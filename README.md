1. How a virtual machine works?
A virtual machine is an application that emulates a whole computer and runs inside your physical computer. It works as a separate independent machine, but it runs as a process on your host operating system. It's a convenient way to dedicate a portion of your computer resources to a specific task or software.

2. What SELinux or AppArmor is?
AppArmor ("Application Armor") or Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to define access controls for the applications, processes, and files on a system. AppArmor works by granting access first, then applying restrictions. SELinux, however, restricts access to all applications by default and grants access only to users that present the proper certifications.
